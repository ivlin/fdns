# Firejail DNS-over-HTTPS Proxy Server

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a next-generation communication protocol on track on becoming a major Internet standard (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8484/">RFC 8484</a>). By adding strong encryption and authentication to the good old DNS protocol, DoH tries to eliminate some of the biggest problems DNS had from the beginning: censorship, surveillance, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

FDNS was designed to run as a local DoH proxy on a Linux desktop, or as a server for a small network. Lean and mean, it protects the computers against some of the most common cyber threats, all while improving the privacy and the system performance.

FDNS is written in C and licensed under GPLv3. The number one job is privacy. We use <b>only</b> DoH services from non-logging providers, while preferring small operators such as open-source enthusiasts and privacy-oriented non-profit organizations.

## Notes on this fork
This fork significantly alters some of the structures of the original fdns code. It implements the k-resolver strategy described in the following paper:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08901"> K-resolver: Towards Decentralizing Encrypted DNS Resolution</a>. It divides DNS lookup load across multiple possible resolvers. The resolver list is not kept up-to-date - when it contacts a nonfunctional resolver, it will fallback to standard DNS.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Works out of the box with little or no configuration changes.</li>
<li>Network of 60+ non-logging DoH service providers spread around the globe. The servers are organized in several categories using a simple geographically-aware tagging system.</li>
<li>Access to specialized DoH services such as family filtering, adblocking, security, OpenNIC.</li>
<li>DNS resolver cache with a fixed TTL (default 15 minutes).</li>
<li>Blocking ads, first and third-party trackers, coinminers, etc. The filters are configurable, the user can add his own hosts filter.</li>
<li>Blocking IPv6 queries by default to reduce the DNS traffic on IPv4 networks.</li>
<li>Anti-tunneling technology: by default only A and AAAA queries are forwarded.</li>
<li>Conditional DNS forwarding support.</li>
<li>Regular DNS over UDP fallback in case the DoH service becomes unavailable.</li>
<li>Live DNS request monitoring and statistics.</li>
<li>Scalable multi-process design with a frontend process and several independent resolver processes. Security technologies: chroot, seccomp, Linux namespaces, and AppArmor.</li>
<li>Seamless integration with <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com">Firejail security sandbox</a>.</li> 
</ul>
